# ArkhamCityManualAP
A manual Archipelago Randomizer for Batman: Arkham City.
To be used with the [Manual for Archipelago](https://github.com/ManualForArchipelago) project.

# How to Setup
1. Download the B:AC Manual AP and put it in your Archipelago/custom_worlds folder.
2. In the Archipelago Client, click on "Generate Template Options" to get the YAML file for the AP.
3. Download the APWorld from Manual for Archipelago's "Manual" GitHub page and put it in your Archipelago/custom_worlds folder.
4. Restart your Archipelago client and start up the "Manual Client".
5. Connect to the server using the B:AC Manual AP in the client.

# How to Play
As of now, this AP supports the main story and several side missions.
As for items, these include:
* The Locations (Courthouse, Church, Steel Mill (Front and Back are seperate), GCPD and more...)
* Level Ups (Not all of them)
* The Main Story Gadgets (REC, Disruptor, Line Launcher and Freeze Blast)

If you don't have these items unlocked in your Manual Client, you can't use them yet.

The checks include:
* Main Story bosses
* TYGER cameras
* Riddler Challenges (20, 40, 60, 80, 100 so far)
* Fragile Alliance side mission
* The Tea Party side mission
* Remote Hideaway side mission
* AR Training (incl. Grapnel Boost)
* Heart of Ice side mission
* Hot And Cold side mission
* Watcher in the Wings side mission
* Identity Theft side mission

It is advised to complete all possible checks that are in logic to prevent accidental BKs.
(For example, if you are in the Steel Mill and didn't get the 100 Riddler Challenges for the REC, you essentially locked yourself out and may have to start over, or unlock the REC in the Archipelago server's admin console.)

This project is still in early development. If you encounter any bugs or logic errors, let me know via the Issues tab.
